She takes her children to the kindergarten and school by cargo bike and then rides to the train station, where she gets a 25 minute ride to work at the center of the city. This was a big change in her commute, and Chiara wasn't too happy about spending more time of her day commuting, but she started enjoying the time at the train. Sitting by herself, she could relax and do something that she would not otherwise do.  \n \n\nChiara started to take this time to read a book. But after some time, she felt that 25 minutes each time were not enough to really get into the story. \n \n She then tried reading a magazine, but because she prefers long, in-depth, articles, the same problem happened. \n \n\nSo, she just started checking what was happening on Facebook. It got her so much drawn into the contents that sometimes she almost forgot to leave at the right station. Chiara decided that accelerating her brain and heart so much wasn't the best way to start a day. \n \n\nSo, she finally tried something that worked. Because they moved to a Dutch speaking area, she felt like learning the language. Using a language learning app, the time at the train was enough for two or three lessons each ride. It also gives the right cadency for language learning: a little bit each day, steadily leading her to a better connection to the people in her new neighborhood. \n \n \n\nChiara's best fit was a function of the amount of time she had and what she felt doing in this phase of her life. \n \n \n What about you?

He's not the only one; loads of people report that many of their best ideas appear to them when they're showering! \n \n\nWhat about when we're moving? Is there any moment which tends to be especially productive for people? \n \n\nAs a matter a fact, there is one way of moving from one place to another that seems to be particularly good if you want to wander into new ideas. Several bright thinkers seemed to have discovered this advantage and purposefully moved in that form of moving when they wanted to have better thoughts about something. \n \n\nHint: some of them, like Beethoven, Dickens and Darwin, lived when there were no motorized vehicles around… \n \n\nHint 2: It is a form of moving that activates the brain. \n \n\nWhat's your guess?

He also did meetings with people in that way. Instead of an office room, he brought them for a walk. \n \n\nBut is there any scientific explanation for this, or were these just random phenomena? \n \n\nWell, there are studies that show that when humans walk, there are parts of their brain  which become more activated. A study with school children showed that children that arrived in the morning to perform a test, had their brain much more active if they had arrived walking than if they had arrived by car. \n \n\nOf course, for the brain to be free for ideas while walking, it seems to be important that there are no major environmental disturbances that oblige you to pay attention to where your going, like obstacles, traffic or too much noise. Cities designed with better conditions for walking are better cities for generating great ideas! \n \n\nTo promote productive walking meetings, someone had a bright idea (maybe she was walking or showering, we don't really know!): To build an APP which would define paths in the city that were particularly good for walking meetings. This app is called Weeting and has meeting walking routes for several cities in The Netherlands. \n \n\nHow good are your walking paths for thinking?\n";

As he passed, old men in the street yelled to him “GO, CYCLIST, GO” as if he were in the Tour. Car drivers honked “GET OUT OF THE ROAD”. \n \n\nHe believed that people should be able to use their bike to move around in the city, and he felt as that pioneer hero that gave the example to the future generations of bike commuters. \n \n\nHe also wanted to prove that cycling was fast, and so he started to choose the quicker paths even if they had heavy traffic, just to save 5 minutes. The less time it took, the better. \n \n\n2. As the statement effect faded, he started noticing more the stressful part of the experience, and the occasional sweat. So, he decided to slow down his pace. But he was so used to pedal hard, that it took him a year to get used to ride at a slower pace. He came to appreciate the Dutch style, relaxed, way of cycling. He chose again the calmer routes. \n \n\n3. After having children, he took each of them to kindergarten and school before starting the 35 minute ride to work. The only alternative to the bicycle was the car, which wasn't an option he wanted to take, so he started getting fed up of having no choices. “I miss it when I could go by metro and relax”. And so Pedro started taking the metro whenever he didn't have to take the kids. \n \n\n4. When his wife could again take the kids on some days, the release of the obligation to cycle made him recover part of the pleasure of cycling. But he still felt it to be consuming his time unproductively. He had got used to taking his public transport time to think and read. \n \n\n5. One day, as he was cooking dinner, Pedro decided to hear a podcast. He loved it and thought how much better this made his cooking time. He would learn things and hear stories from other people. He started enjoying cooking time. \n \n\nAfter that, he took him another year to understand that he could do the same in his cycling time routine. With podcasts, his cycling routes became even more slow and long. Each 5 more minutes riding were 5 minutes of podcast pleasure. \n \n\n6. Later, Pedro changed job and started working from home. His belly suddenly increased size, as he stopped doing the now 45 minute ride to work. Looking at his augmented belly, Pedro realized that the cycling to work over the past years had kept him fit. He started seizing every opportunity, like going to meetings, to go by bike. \n \n\n7. But his cycling time was about to improve even more. As his children grew up, he realized that the travel time to school with them were part of the best moments of his live. His children showed that they loved going with him, asked dozens of questions and told him about the latest news at the school. This made his cycling time more worthwhile than anything else. \n \n\n";

It’s something more concrete. \n \n\nHow much time do you exactly take travelling from point A to point B? You’ll probably say: well it’s my journey time, of course! \n \n\nWell, from a certain perspective, it isn’t. It might even actually be much more than that… \n \n\nThink about it: to travel from point A to point B, you probably had to spend some money. If you’re travelling by car, that is all the costs associated to riding and possessing a car. If you’re going by public transport, that’s the cost of your ticket. Even if you’re walking, you’re at least wearing your shoes, and you’ll end up having to replace them more quickly. \n \n\nBut what does money have to do with travel time? \n \n\nTo obtain money, you (or someone else for you) has to work to gain it, and working takes time. So, the time of your travel is not only the time you spend travelling, it’s also the time you spend earning the money necessary for travelling. \n \n\nFor example, take a car. On average a car costs, all expenses included, 350 euros a month. The amount of work that you have to put in monthly to pay that car, add it to your travel time of the trips for that month. That’s your virtual travel time. \n \n\nIf you're fortunate, you might say that working is not loss of time, because you love working. And you might also say the same about travelling to work, maybe. Yes, that makes the issue even more complicated. \n \n\nHow fo you see it? Share your thoughts with us :-)\n \nhttps://www.facebook.com/MotivProject.eu/ \n\nhttps://twitter.com/MoTiV_Project\n";
